Somzoa is meant to hypnotize and take you onto an obscure ride. It all started out with some video's of protozoa under a microscope that I had my DLR mounted to. This eventually led to me making a video for the High Focus record label and hosting a stream on Twitch showcasing live microscopy of protozoa, occopanied with experimental bass music. I eventually decided to hop on the music production train myself after years of deep fascination for ambient & bass music. Check out some of my work below.     </motion.p>
