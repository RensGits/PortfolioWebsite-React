As I just invested my time in creating page transitions with <span><a href = 'https://www.framer.com/docs/' target = '_blank'> framer-motion</a></span> , and since framer motion requires react 16.8 and up, i decided to integrate my models using google's <span><a href = 'https://modelviewer.dev/' target="_blank">Model-Viewer</a></span>.I ran into some compatibility issues and was able to get my models up by launching a seperate react project and framing my models with Iframe. It wasn't a great solution and I decided to wait until React-three-fiber released an update that would allow me to use it with react 16.8. And long behold, shortly after they rolled out a release that supports react 16.8: <span><a href = 'https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction' target = '_blank'> @react-three/fiber.</a></span></p>

            {"To display 3D models we need to set up a 3D environment for the object to live in. This environment consists of a scene, a camera and a renderer. In react this is simplified by combining the scene and camera in the <Canvas> component. By placing a <mesh></mesh> jsx element we can render objects in the scene. Our mesh element requires two components; a geometry that defines the shape of the object and a material that defines the look of the object (texture, color, light-effects etc). In this case I used a boxBufferGeometry that you guessed it, defines the geometry of a cube, and a meshStandardMaterial. Any geometry in three-fiber requires an args prop that takes in an array defining the objects proportions or other parameters that concern it's form factor. In the case of our box-geometry, it takes an array of 3 parameters controlling it's size on the x, y & z axis. For all the available geometries and their args input I recommend checking out "}<span><a target = '_blank' href = 'https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-primitives.html#:~:text=Three.js%20has%20a%20large%20number%20of%20primitives.%20Primitives,primitives%20to%20experiment%20and%20get%20started%20with%203D.'> threejsfundamentals.org</a></span>.

            <p style = {{fontSize: '0.8em'}}>To have the model automatically rotating, we need to update our model by re-rendering our component for each frame. We get the objects current state by using the useRef hook on our mesh. In this case we want to retrieve the rotation around the x axis. We then update the mesh with the useFrame hook which comes with react-three-fiber. The useFrame hook allows you to execute code on each frame of the animation. The last thing we need to do is add a directional light to our canvas. This will create difference in value depending on what parts of our model are facing the light, allowing us to see the depth of our object. </p>
