              a passion for graphic design, but my interest have shifted over
              the years. I dropped out of artschool after a year of graphic
              design to study biology because I wanted to learn more about how
              things worked, in a theoretical sense. But my passion for design
              has never left me, and I felt that even in biology, I was
              constantly looking to transform the things I was learning in
              something that was more interesting to look at, something that
              made other people intrigued with biology, or simply for my own
              enjoyment. 
              <p style = {{marginTop: '2em'}}> Recently, I’ve started to learn how to code, and ever
              since I started I’ve been hooked. I realised that UI design and Front-end development is the perfect career for me. </p>
