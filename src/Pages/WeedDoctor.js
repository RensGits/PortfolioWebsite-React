With the help of a simple multiple-choice question model, the user can find out what is wrong with his/her plant without having to know anything about biolgy. We have created a matrix that narrows down nutrient deficiencies and nutrient exccess based on different visual keys in the leaves such as shape of discoloration, orientation, color, position and more. After going through a few easy to understand questions, the user will be send to a diagnose page that explains in detail how the pathology could have been caused and what steps they can undertake to fix the problem.   </motion.p>
